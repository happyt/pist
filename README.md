Simple rss reader that will log to mongodb and send to vizrt
============================================================

Written for the Pistorius' trial and
will access the court transcript feed
from the ScribbleLive system.

Staarted by reading the feed and storing in database
Added commands to send to viz


Need to loop and get more messages
Throw away any messages already published
Test reliable connection to viz, maybe with a delay

Would be nice to have a web page
  allow to turn ON/OFF
  choose the viz by IP address
  select from history?
  select memorable quotes?

Might move across to the JSON API
